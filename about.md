My name is Brandon and I'm an outdoor nut, cyclist, scientist, and data enthusiast.  This is my first attempt at a website to talk about me.  

I've worked in environmental cleanup, photography, analytics, and data science.  Currently I reside in Knoxville, Tennessee and try to get outside any time I can.  

If you'd like to reach me use my email bmbagley@gmail.com or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandonmbagley/)
